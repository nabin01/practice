# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49,
# 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new
# list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = [aa for aa in a if aa % 2 == 0]
print(b)

# test using random list
# import random # always import at the beginning
#
# a = list(random.sample(range(100), 20))
# b = [aa for aa in a if aa % 2 == 0]
# print(a)
# print(b)
