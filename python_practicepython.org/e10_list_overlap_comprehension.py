# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5),
# except require the solution in a different way.
#
# Take two lists, say for example these two:
# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
#
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are
# common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on
# two lists of different sizes. Write this in one line of Python using at least
# one list comprehension. (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).

# Extra:
# Randomly generate two lists to test this

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

c = list([aa for aa in set(a) if aa in b]) # converting to set removes duplicates
print(c)

# extra
# import random # always import in the beginning of the code
# a = random.sample(range(100), 10)
# b = random.sample(range(100), 10)
# c = list([aa for aa in set(a) if aa in b])
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
